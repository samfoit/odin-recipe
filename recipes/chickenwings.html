    <h4>Description</h4>
    <p>
        Chicken wings are white meat, even though they're juicier and have a more concentrated poultry flavor, 
        like dark meat. Many people think of Buffalo wings when they think of this part of the chicken, and for 
        good reason: they're extremely popular throughout the United States.
